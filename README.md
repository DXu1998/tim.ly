Pomodoro timer app

An app I'm creating as a summer project to learn iOS development

Basic functionality is pomodoro timer, but planned features include:

<ul>

  <li>Live syncing across devices
  <li>Todoist integration
  <li>Statistical analyses for time tracking nerds
  <li>Continued functioning of timer when app is closed
